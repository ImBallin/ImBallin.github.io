	<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;"> My name is Lanston Harner, I am 18 years old and the youngest in the family of five. I am blessed to have a family who is christian and strives 
	serve Christ in everything they do. My parents Debbie and Scott have been together 27 years. My father is a parts manager for Cummins Power Systems and my father is a nurse. My sisters are twins 
	and 4 years older than me. My sister Lynae is recently married to my brother-in-law David, and my other sister Lyndsay is currently in Quito, Ecuador teaching English. Me and my family are
	from Palmyra, Pennsylvania and we have always lived in Pennsylvania. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family who loves God and me as much as they do.
	
	<h1 style="text-align:center;">Academic Information and Future Plans</h1>

	<p> I am a first year freshman studying Information Technology at <a href="http://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> . After I graduate college I would love to work building machines such as data systems and computers
		as well as networking and security. I really enjoy it here at Bob Jones, before school started I had never visted this campus before, but I have really settled 
		in. Everyone here has been so beneficial to me getting to know how things work and how to get around campus. I am thankful for the opportunity God has given me 
		to come to a school like this and learn IT as well as learn about God and what plans He has for me.

	<h1 style="text-align:center;"> About My Interests </h1>	
			<p style="text-align:center;"> I am very passionate when it comes to hobbies. It is nice that God has allowed me to pursue the things I love from just recreational 
			fun to a career path. The first hobby on my list is sports, my favorite sports are: basketball, volleyball, flag football, and ultamite frisbee. My favorite of the 
			four is basketball, I try to play at least once a week. When I was a kid I played baseball for ten years until I got tired of it and decided to try out basketball.
			Looking back I wish that I would have played basketball for than 4 years, but that just has given me more motivation to get better to be able to compete with better 
			players. </p>
			
			<p style="text-align:center;"> The second hobby on that list is my favorite. I have grown up spending alot of time in the outdoors, and my love for the outdoors has 
			grown immensely. I love the outdoors but specifically I love fishing. My dad and my grandpa have taken me fishing since I have been able to breathe, therefore fishing 
			to me is like breathing. When I was about 10 me and my Dad starting fishing the <a href="http://www.riversmallies.com/">Susquehanna River</a>. I struggled at first and even became discouraged because it was very
			hard for me to do well. As I matured I began to become more determined and began to soak in more of what my Gradfather had to teach me, it was then I became an excellent 
			fisherman. Today I enjoy fishing the Susquehanna River more than anything else, and being down here at college is hard because the fall season is the best fishing time 
			of the year. I can't wait to spend time with my Dad on the river again. Here is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1978768435745648.1073741834.100008375315229&type=1&l=618c132ca8">link</a>
			to my outdoors photo album.
			
			<p style="text-align:center;"> Lastly I love computers. Ever since my freshman year of high school I really was entrigued with them. I started taking them apart and 
			putting them back together again. I might have started learning about computers alot later then alot of other people, but that dosent mean that I have any less zeal to
			learn than someone who has worked with computers their whole life. The most exciting part about this hobby is that I have been able to turn it into a career path. So 
			far computers is what I am studying at Bob Jones University and it is what I would love to do the rest of my life.
